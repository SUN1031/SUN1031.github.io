# About Me

I received my Master’s degree in Robotics in August 2024.

During my graduate studies, I worked on robot perception, control, and autonomous systems through coursework, laboratory projects, and my master’s thesis.

My main interests include:

- Mobile robotics
- Motion planning
- Robot control
- Perception and sensor fusion
- ROS / ROS2-based systems

I enjoy building robotic systems from low-level control to high-level autonomy and continuously expanding my knowledge through personal projects.
