# About Me

![profile photo](/assets/images/me.jpg)

Hello, I'm **Choi Byeongseon**.
I build a robots and try to teach them how to interact with the world.

I think of myself as **a man leaning on a raft on the vast ocean**-
standing on something I built, surrounded by possibilties I can't fully see yet.

I came to robotics because I enjoy watching code cross into the physical world-
the moment a machine I programmed begins to move, see, and act on its own.
That moment still feels a little like magic, even after many lines of debugging.

### What drives me

Among all parts of robotics, **vision** fascinates me the most.
To give a machine eyes is to give it a relationship with reality-
light, depth, noise, and uncertainty becoming information instead of obstacles.

I enjoy the entire path from idea to movement:
from algorithms on a screen to motors turning on the floor,
from abstract models to something that can be touched.

### Background (the short version)

- **M.Sc. in Robotics**, 2024
- **B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering**
- Focus on perception, motion planning, and intelligent systems
